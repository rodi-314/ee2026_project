# EE2026 — Digital Design Project

This group project was completed as part of the EE2026 Digital Design course taught at the National University of Singapore (NUS). The goal of the project was to create an application or game using the provided Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA boards and OLED screens. We were required to utilise the knowledge and technical skills gained from previous labs and assignments to complete this project. For more informtion and details, view the full report [here](<Reports/Final Report.pdf>).

## Introduction to our Chinese Mahjong Project

This project involves creating a multiplayer Mahjong game where each of the 4 players are controlling their hand using their own Basys 3 board. The rules of the game are the same as in traditional Chinese Mahjong, with the exception that flower and animal tiles will be excluded from the game. The OLED screen on each of the player’s Basys 3 boards will display their own hand along with the drawn tile if it is their turn. Players will wait for their turn to make their move, and they can select which tiles to discard by turning on the switch corresponding to the desired tile.
